# Tugas-3-Comprehensive-Analysis-on-Climate-Data

Introduction
This assessment covers Data Science, SQL Database Management, Data Product Development, and making a societal impact. You will use SQL queries to fetch data, Data Science techniques for analysis, and develop a dashboard to showcase your findings.

Dataset.
Download relevant Natural Disasters and Economic Damage from:

https://github.com/dataenergy/Exploratory-data-analysis-of-climate-change-and-natural-disasters/blob/master/datasets/number-of-natural-disaster-events.csvLinks to an external site.
https://github.com/dataenergy/Exploratory-data-analysis-of-climate-change-and-natural-disasters/blob/master/datasets/economic-damage-from-natural-disasters.csvLinks to an external site.

Part 1: SQL Database Setup and Queries.
1.1 Database: SQL Query I
       1. Import the downloaded dataset into a SQL database.
       2. Write an SQL query to fetch `Year` and any relevant variables (e.g., `Number of natural disasters`, `Economic damage`).
1.2 Database: SQL Query II

Write SQL query to show Total Natural Disaster and Economic Damage for every type of Disaster (Entity)
Write an SQL query to summarize the data per 10 year, calculating averages and sums for Natural disaster & Economic damage.
Part 2: Data Science and Statistical Analysis.
Refer to the previous assignment framework for exercises on Descriptive and Inferential Statistics, EDA, and Statistical Modeling.

Part 3: Data Product Development.
Data Product Development (Dashboard)
Develop a dashboard showcasing:
1. Historical trends for all type of Natural Disasters and the Economic Damage.
2. Predictive models for future Disasters and Economic Damage.
3. Yearly summaries.
Use Google Data Studio.

Part 4: Making Impact with Data Science
Write a report (500-1000 words) on how the findings can contribute to societal change in the context of climate. Discuss potential strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Use additional data from valid reference if you will.
